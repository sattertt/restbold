restbold pipeline 


This is a piece of code for Upenn collaborators that implements the resting bold pipeline here

Satterthwaite, T.D., et al (2013). An improved framework for confound regression and filtering for control of motion artifact in the preprocessing of resting-state functional connectivity data. Neuroimage 64, 240-256.

Note that the config file simply sets paths for the script to use.  This script is most easily used within a wrapper that submits to a grid (e.g. using qsub), but wrappers will tend to be highly related to an individual study's directory structure.

Please feel free to email me at sattertt@upenn.edu if you encoutner issues.
